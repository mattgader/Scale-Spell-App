      "major_scale": "The major scale (or Ionian mode) is one of the most commonly used musical scales, especially in Western music. It is one of the diatonic scales. Like many musical scales, it is made up of seven notes: the eighth duplicates the first at double its frequency so that it is called a higher octave of the same note (from Latin \"octavus\", the eighth).",
      "interval_music": "In music theory, an interval is a difference in pitch between two sounds. \nAn interval may be described as horizontal, linear, or melodic if it refers to successively sounding tones, such as two adjacent pitches in a melody, and vertical or harmonic if it pertains to simultaneously sounding tones, such as in a chord.In Western music, intervals are most commonly differences between notes of a diatonic scale. The smallest of these intervals is a semitone.",
      "semitone": "A semitone, also called a half step or a half tone, is the smallest musical interval commonly used in Western tonal music, and it is considered the most dissonant when sounded harmonically.\nIt is defined as the interval between two adjacent notes in a 12-tone scale. For example, C is adjacent to C\u266f; the interval between them is a semitone.",
      "major_second": "In Western music theory, a major second (sometimes also called whole tone or a whole step)  is a second spanning two semitones (Play ). A second is a musical interval encompassing two adjacent staff positions (see Interval number for more details). For example, the interval from C to D is a major second, as the note D lies two semitones above C, and the two notes are notated on adjacent staff positions."
