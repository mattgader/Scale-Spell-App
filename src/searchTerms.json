      "major_scale": "The major scale (or Ionian mode) is one of the most commonly used musical scales, especially in Western music. It is one of the diatonic scales. Like many musical scales, it is made up of seven notes: the eighth duplicates the first at double its frequency so that it is called a higher octave of the same note (from Latin \"octavus\", the eighth).",
      "interval_music": "In music theory, an interval is a difference in pitch between two sounds. \nAn interval may be described as horizontal, linear, or melodic if it refers to successively sounding tones, such as two adjacent pitches in a melody, and vertical or harmonic if it pertains to simultaneously sounding tones, such as in a chord.In Western music, intervals are most commonly differences between notes of a diatonic scale. The smallest of these intervals is a semitone.",
      "semitone": "A semitone, also called a half step or a half tone, is the smallest musical interval commonly used in Western tonal music, and it is considered the most dissonant when sounded harmonically.\nIt is defined as the interval between two adjacent notes in a 12-tone scale. For example, C is adjacent to C\u266f; the interval between them is a semitone.",
      "major_second": "In Western music theory, a major second (sometimes also called whole tone or a whole step)  is a second spanning two semitones (Play ). A second is a musical interval encompassing two adjacent staff positions (see Interval number for more details). For example, the interval from C to D is a major second, as the note D lies two semitones above C, and the two notes are notated on adjacent staff positions.",
      "accidental_music": "In music, an accidental is a note of a pitch (or pitch class) that is not a member of the scale or mode indicated by the most recently applied key signature. In musical notation, the sharp (\u266f), flat (\u266d), and natural (\u266e) symbols, among others, mark such notes\u2014and those symbols are also called accidentals.\nIn the measure (bar) where it appears, an accidental sign raises or lowers the immediately following note (and any repetition of it in the bar) from its normal pitch, overriding the key signature.",
      "pitch_music": "Pitch is a perceptual property of sounds that allows their ordering on a frequency-related scale,\nor more commonly, pitch is the quality that makes it possible to judge sounds as \"higher\" and \"lower\" in the sense associated with musical melodies.  \nPitch is a major auditory attribute of musical tones, along with duration, loudness, and timbre.Pitch may be quantified as a frequency, but pitch is not a purely objective physical property; it is a subjective psychoacoustical attribute of sound. Historically, the study of pitch and pitch perception has been a central problem in psychoacoustics, and has been instrumental in forming and testing theories of sound representation, processing, and perception in the auditory system."
