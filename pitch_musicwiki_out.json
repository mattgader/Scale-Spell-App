{"name": "Pitch is a perceptual property of sounds that allows their ordering on a frequency-related scale,\nor more commonly, pitch is the quality that makes it possible to judge sounds as \"higher\" and \"lower\" in the sense associated with musical melodies.  \nPitch is a major auditory attribute of musical tones, along with duration, loudness, and timbre.Pitch may be quantified as a frequency, but pitch is not a purely objective physical property; it is a subjective psychoacoustical attribute of sound. Historically, the study of pitch and pitch perception has been a central problem in psychoacoustics, and has been instrumental in forming and testing theories of sound representation, processing, and perception in the auditory system."}
