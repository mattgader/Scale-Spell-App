{"name": "In Western music theory, a major second (sometimes also called whole tone or a whole step)  is a second spanning two semitones (Play ). A second is a musical interval encompassing two adjacent staff positions (see Interval number for more details). For example, the interval from C to D is a major second, as the note D lies two semitones above C, and the two notes are notated on adjacent staff positions."}
