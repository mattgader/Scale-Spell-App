{"name": "In music theory, an interval is a difference in pitch between two sounds. \nAn interval may be described as horizontal, linear, or melodic if it refers to successively sounding tones, such as two adjacent pitches in a melody, and vertical or harmonic if it pertains to simultaneously sounding tones, such as in a chord.In Western music, intervals are most commonly differences between notes of a diatonic scale. The smallest of these intervals is a semitone."}
